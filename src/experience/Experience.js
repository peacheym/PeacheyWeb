		<h2>Teaching Assistant</h2><h3 className="employer">Dalhousie University</h3>
		<p>I have been a teaching assistant for CSCI1110 (Intro To Computer Science), CSCI1170 (Intro to Web Development), and CSCI2170 (Intro to Server Side Scripting). In these roles I am responsible for giving tutorial presentations on class material to groups of 50+ students as well as holding weekly office hours to meet with students individually. I also work in the class lab where I present weekly activities and provide assistance to students when required. This experience forces me to communicate important concepts in a way that my fellow students are able to comprehend.</p>
		<p>I value this experience as it is a well known fact that teaching somebody is the best way to ensure that you have mastered the material yourself. Futhermore, my responsibilites as a TA also include marking weekly assignments as well as proctoring tests throughout each semester.</p>

		<h2>Web Developer</h2><h3 className="employer">FUNSports</h3>
		<p>In April 2019, I created a website for a new non-profit organization called FUNSports. The website&lsquo;s goal is to be a page filled with information about the new but growing organization. For the remainer of 2019, I continued to work with the organization to ensure that their website meet their needs and desires.</p>
<p>FUNSports goal is to provide access to sports for kids who otherwise may not have the oppertunity. Many organizations already provide access to summer camps or other short-term programs, but FUNSports aims to help kids pursue full time athletic careers. This means that kids who are high achieving athletes but do not have the necessary finacial support will not be forced to give up their dreams of competing at the highest levels.</p>
		<p>If FUNSports sounds like an organization that you would like to support, please visit their website:<a href="http://funsports.fun">funsports.fun</a></p>

		<h2>WiTS Peer Mentor</h2><h3 className="employer">Dalhousie University</h3>
		<p>In September 2018, Dalhousie&lsquo;s Women in Technology Society launched their peer mentorship program. I was eager to be involved as I understand the value of supporting women who are new to the technology field.</p>
		<p>I acted as a peer mentor for two female students coming to Dalhousie for their first year of computer science. I offered connections and resources to my mentees to help make their first year as effective and useful as possible.</p>
