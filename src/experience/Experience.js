		<h2>Software Developer (Co-op)</h2><h3>Ultra Electronics Maratime Systems</h3>
		<p>As a software developer (co-op) at Ultra Electronics Maritime Systems I worked on an agile team to implement features for UEMSs suite of services using Java, C++, and Python. Being my first work term, this valuable experience taught me the fundamentals of professional software development. I gained important experience working with industry tools such as Linux, Git (Bit-Bucket), JIRA, and many more.</p>
		<p>Thank you to the team at UEMS for having me as a Co-op student, I really enjoyed my time working with you all!</p>
