          Thanks to my interest in graduate studies following the completion of
          my Bachelor of Computer Science, I have actively pursued research
          opportunities during my undergraduate degree. I have been fortunate
          enough to work with the GEM Lab since early 2020, and have contributed
          to several exciting projects in that time.

          towards the completion of my undergraduate honours thesis. For this
          project, we are exploring hand-tracking technologies and how to best
          represent the data they produce. We are not looking for a singular
          best way, but rather looking to represent the data in such a manner
          that as many use cases can be easily implemented with one structure.
          This work is currently ongoing, and this page will be updated as
          progress is made.
