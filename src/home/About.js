                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a third year student at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I am currently studying Computer Science and have a particular interest in the Internet of Things (IOT). I am also interested in learning more about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence as well as software development as a whole.</p>
                <p>Through my studies I have developed a strong understanding of the fundamentals of Computer Science such as data structures and algorithims, as well as object oriented programming techniques. I have also recently enjoyed learning about web development and the interesting frameworks and technologies built around it.</p>
