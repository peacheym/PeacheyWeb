            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I am a fourth year student at Dalhousie University in Halifax,
              Nova Scotia. I am currently studying Computer Science and have a
              particular interest in Computer Vision as well as the Internet of
              Things (IOT).
            </p>
            <p>
              Through my studies I have developed a strong understanding of the
              fundamentals of Computer Science such as data structures,
              algorithms, and machine learning. I have also recently enjoyed
              learning about web development and the interesting frameworks and
              technologies built around it.
